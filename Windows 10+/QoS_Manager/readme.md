Both scripts were written using an AI LLM, after approximately 20 iterations and about 10 corrections for each of them. Hehe. xD

v01: Basic, simple version, more thoroughly tested.
v02: Improved version that includes grid data validation at every step as well as detailed error messages when errors occur.

Since the code in v02 is more complex, it may contain bugs or issues. If u found problems with v02 - use scrpt v01.
