Both scripts were written using an AI LLM, after approximately 20 iterations and about 10 corrections for each of them. Hehe. xD <br>

v01: Basic, simple version, more thoroughly tested. <br>
v02: Improved version that includes grid data validation at every step as well as detailed error messages when errors occur.<br>

Since the code in v02 is more complex, it may contain bugs or issues. If u found problems with v02 - use scrpt v01.<br>
